# psiterm
Psiayn's Terminal Emulator. It is spid and debian doesn't have alacritty T-T.

## What works
- Copy Paste with `Ctrl+Shift+C` and `Ctrl+Shift+V`.
- Zoom in is `Ctrl +` and zoom out is `Ctrl -`
- No tabs as of now. Tmux ftw.


### Reference.
The whole thing was 'inspired' by the following article.
[Write your own terminal.](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-write-own-terminal).
