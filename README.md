# psiterm
Psiayn's Terminal Emulator. I am bored, don't like gnome terminal because it's slow and sadly alacritty and gnome don't play nice. So this is the result of that.

## What works
- Copy Paste with `Ctrl+Shift+C` and `Ctrl+Shift+V`.
- No tabs as of now. Tmux ftw.


### Reference.
The whole thing was 'inspired' by the following article.
[Write your own terminal.](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-write-own-terminal).
